Football League Database

The idea is to make databases of leages by entering match results between clubs.
First a user must do a login to get to his own database.
Then he can create his own league with clubs. When he wishes he can use data from for example the Premier League of a certain season.
When data is entered then it's possible to view the ranking of the whole season or a part of that by changing end date or start date.
