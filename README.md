oFootball League Database

The idea is to make databases of leages by entering match results between clubs.
First a user must do a login to get to his own database.
Then he can create his own league with clubs. If he wishes he can put in real data of for example the Premier League from a certain season.
When more data is added it's possible to view the ranking of the whole season or a part of that by changing end date or start date.
