Data Centric Development – Kris Dikkeschei

This is my Data Centric Development project. It's my 3rd milestone project for Code Institute. I came on the idea of Football League Database because I am always curious to look back to sport results in the past. Now it will be possible to get a database for that.
Click here for my deployed project hosted on Heroku.

User stories
•	As a user : As a new visitor to the Football League Database, I want the page to be easily navigated.
•	As a user: As a new visitor I want clear instructions on how to add, view, update matches.
•	As a user: I want a web app that responds quickly to my interaction.
•	As a user: I want also good access on smaller devices.

Strategy
•	The goal of the website is to provide the visitor the option to create their own database of matches and organize them to get it displayed in a ranking list
•	The user is allowed to add, delete and edit clubs, leagues and matches.
•	When club names are changed, the database as a whole will be searched to get the ranking list updated
•	When club or league is deleted a warning is shown that all references will be deleted as well. Those references are all shown so the user can see what the consequences are.

Database
•	The database chosen for this is a non-relational database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
•	The web application uses 3 database collections, 'Clubs', Leagues and 'Matches'.

 Skeleton
