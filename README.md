Football League Database

The idea is to make datatbases to view games sorted to clubs, but also to get better ranking results by altering default dates to custom dates.To do so you can see a ranking by choosing a part of a season. 

But first a database must be created and therefore there is a source needed where playing results are stored. I didn't find good content on the internet but I found a dutch site with raw date results for world wide competitions here:
https://www.voetbal.com/wedstrijdgegevens/ned-eredivisie-2020-2021-spieltag/34/
With a lot of copy paste action it was possible to put the raw data together in an excel file.
With excel it's possible to filter it to a nice sorted result.
If found on internet a tool to convert excel data to an mysql database by using this: https://sqlizer.io/#/
After that te first sql file of the Dutch Eredisie Season 2020/2021 could be added.
